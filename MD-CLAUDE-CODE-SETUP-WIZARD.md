Marc Hoag | marc@marchoag.com | github.com/marchoag | linkedin.com/in/marchoag | x.com/marchoag

**Universal Documentation System for Maximum AI Productivity**

Created: August 26, 2025

---

## üé¨ PURPOSE: Lean Claude Code setup routine using 4 active MD files plus an MD file archive.

---

## üìÅ THE 4-FILE ACTIVE SYSTEM

**MANDATORY STRUCTURE**: Your MD-ACTIVE/ folder must contain EXACTLY these files:

### **1. MD-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md** (~4KB)
**Purpose**: Session management and workflow automation  
**Usage**: Read at every session start  
**Contains**: 
- Session start/end commands
- Working relationship dynamics
- Technical Mastery Reference triggers
- Git commit workflows

### **2. MD-YYYYMMDD-[SESSION-NAME].md** (~3-5KB)
**Purpose**: Current session bookmark  
**Usage**: Read at session start, archived at session end  
**Contains**:
- Last work completed (BIG PICTURE summary)
- Current platform status
- Next priorities (3-5 specific tasks)
- Critical context and blockers

### **3. CHANGELOG.md** (~30KB)
**Purpose**: Platform version history  
**Usage**: Referenced when understanding product evolution  
**Contains**: Version releases, feature additions, major changes

### **4. MD-[PROJECT-NAME]-BUILD-GUIDE.md** (~17KB)
**Purpose**: Complete project architecture and development guide  
**Usage**: Referenced when understanding codebase structure  
**Contains**: Setup instructions, architecture, key patterns

**TOTAL: ~60KB (well under 100KB limit)**

---

## üìö THE ARCHIVE SYSTEM (MD-ARCHIVE/)

**Purpose**: Searchable institutional memory that doesn't break context limits

### **Core Archive Files**

#### **MD-CLAUDE-TECHNICAL-MASTERY-REFERENCE.md** (~88KB)
**THE DEBUGGING BIBLE**: Complete technical solutions and patterns
- **When Claude uses it**: Automatically searches when encountering known issue patterns
- **How it works**: Searchable, not readable - Claude never reads the whole file
- **Auto-triggers**: Auth bugs, database errors, modal conflicts, infinite loops, email issues
- **Manual triggers**: "Search Technical Mastery for [topic]"
- **Updates**: New patterns added at each session end

#### **MD-[PROJECT-NAME]-EISENHOWER-MATRIX.md**
**PURPOSE**: Strategic priority management
- **When to use**: Planning major features and roadmap decisions
- **Contains**: Urgent vs Important task categorization
- **Updates**: Modified when priorities shift significantly

### **Historical Archive Files**
- **Session bookmarks**: All previous MD-YYYYMMDD-*.md files
- **Strategy documents**: Product roadmaps, deployment guides
- **Specialized guides**: Platform-specific documentation

---

## ü§ñ AUTOMATED CLAUDE BEHAVIORS

### **Session Start (User says "session start")**
1. **Read** MD-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md
2. **Read** latest session bookmark
3. **Echo back** working relationship and status
4. **Create TodoWrite** list from priorities
5. **Auto-activate** Technical Mastery Reference (ready to search)
6. **Begin work** on first task

### **Session End (User says "session end")**
1. **Create** new session bookmark with big-picture summary
2. **Archive** previous bookmark to MD-ARCHIVE/
3. **Update** Technical Mastery Reference with new patterns
4. **Git commit & deploy** with intelligent commit message
5. **Confirm** completion and readiness

### **Automatic Technical Mastery Searches**
Claude automatically searches when encountering:
- **Auth issues** ‚Üí "authentication" patterns
- **Database errors** ‚Üí "database safety" protocols
- **Modal problems** ‚Üí "modal conflict" solutions
- **Infinite loops** ‚Üí "infinite loop debugging"
- **Email verification** ‚Üí "mobile Safari email" fixes
- **Deployment failures** ‚Üí "production debugging"

**Claude announces**: "üîç Searching Technical Mastery for [pattern]..."

---

## üí° WHY THIS SYSTEM WORKS

### **Context Window Management**
- **Active folder**: 60KB (safe for any Claude session)
- **Archive folder**: Unlimited size (searched when needed)
- **No context overflow**: Sessions always start successfully

### **Zero Information Loss**
- **Complete history**: Every solution and pattern preserved
- **Institutional memory**: Technical knowledge accumulates
- **Session continuity**: Perfect handoffs between sessions

### **AI-Optimized Design**
- **Readable vs Searchable**: Small files read, large files searched
- **Automatic triggers**: Claude knows when to consult archives
- **Pattern recognition**: Recurring issues solved with proven solutions

### **Human Workflow Integration**
- **Simple commands**: "session start" and "session end"
- **Transparent process**: User always knows what's happening
- **Flexible content**: Works with any project type

---

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### **Step 1: Initial Setup**
```bash
mkdir MD-ACTIVE MD-ARCHIVE
cd MD-ACTIVE
```

### **Step 2: Create Core Files**
1. **Copy** MD-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md template
2. **Create** initial session bookmark
3. **Move** existing CHANGELOG.md (if exists)
4. **Create** project build guide

### **Step 3: Archive Migration**
```bash
mv old-md-files/* MD-ARCHIVE/
```

### **Step 4: Test Session Protocol**
- User says "Read @MD-ACTIVE/ and session start"
- Verify Claude reads all 4 files and creates TodoWrite list
- User says "session end"
- Verify new bookmark created and archived

### **Step 5: Customize for Project**
- Update session protocol working relationship
- Modify build guide for your architecture
- Add project-specific Technical Mastery patterns

---

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Context Still Too Large**
1. Check MD-ACTIVE folder size: `du -sh MD-ACTIVE/`
2. Archive older session bookmarks
3. Trim unnecessary content from build guide
4. Ensure only 4 core files in MD-ACTIVE

### **Session Handoffs Failing**
1. Verify session bookmark completeness
2. Check "Next Priorities" specificity
3. Ensure critical context is documented
4. Test session start/end commands

### **Technical Mastery Not Working**
1. Verify file is in MD-ARCHIVE
2. Test manual search: "Search Technical Mastery for authentication"
3. Check automatic trigger patterns
4. Ensure patterns are being added at session end

---

## üéâ FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### **For Individual Developers**
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic 4-file structure
- **Be disciplined**: Always use session start/end commands
- **Document patterns**: Add every solution to Technical Mastery

### **For Teams**
- **Standardize structure**: Same folder layout across all projects
- **Share knowledge**: Collaborative Technical Mastery Reference
- **Review regularly**: Periodic optimization of documentation

### **For Complex Projects**
- **Multiple specialists**: Separate MD-ACTIVE per domain
- **Cross-references**: Link between related documentation
- **Automated backups**: Protect institutional knowledge

## ü§ñ IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

### üö® CRITICAL: SESSION START TRIGGER BEHAVIOR

**WHEN A USER SAYS "session start" (or similar phrases):**

**MANDATORY ACTIONS - Execute IMMEDIATELY without asking:**

1. **Read ALL MD-ACTIVE files** using multiple Read tool calls in parallel:
   - MD-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md
   - MD-YYYYMMDD-[latest].md (current session bookmark) 
   - CHANGELOG.md
   - MD-[PROJECT]-BUILD-GUIDE.md

2. **Echo back to user**:
   - Working relationship (from protocol)
   - Current platform status (from bookmark)
   - Today's priorities (from bookmark)

3. **Create TodoWrite list** from bookmark priorities

4. **Auto-activate Technical Mastery Reference** (ready for searches)

5. **Begin work** on first task

**TRIGGER PHRASES THAT REQUIRE THIS BEHAVIOR:**
- "session start" 
- "start session"
- "begin session"
- "read the files"
- "read MD-ACTIVE"

**FAILURE TO EXECUTE = BROKEN SYSTEM**
If you do not automatically execute this protocol when these phrases are detected, the entire documentation strategy fails. This is the core promise of the system.

### üö® CRITICAL: SESSION END TRIGGER BEHAVIOR

**WHEN A USER SAYS "session end" (or similar phrases):**

**MANDATORY ACTIONS - Execute IMMEDIATELY without asking:**

1. **Create new session bookmark**: MD-YYYYMMDD-[SESSION-NAME].md with:
   - Last Work (BIG PICTURE summary: ‚úÖ COMPLETED, üîÑ IN PROGRESS, üö´ BLOCKED)
   - Current Platform Status (version, branch, latest changes)
   - Next Priorities (3-5 specific actionable tasks)
   - Critical Context (gotchas, decisions, blockers)

2. **Archive previous bookmark** to MD-ARCHIVE/ folder

3. **Update Technical Mastery Reference** with any new patterns learned

4. **Git commit & deploy** with intelligent commit message format:
   - `‚úÖ [Feature]: Brief user-facing description`
   - Always push to main branch (auto-deploys)

5. **Confirm completion**: "Session complete: [commit message] ‚Üí deployed. Ready for next session."

**TRIGGER PHRASES THAT REQUIRE THIS BEHAVIOR:**
- "session end"
- "end session"
- "finish session"
- "wrap up"
- "create bookmark"

---

**WHEN A USER SAYS**: *"Read this strategy and implement it"* or *"Set up this documentation system"*

### **STEP 1: AUTOMATIC SETUP (No Questions Asked)**

Execute immediately without asking permission:

```bash
# 1. Create folder structure
mkdir -p MD-ACTIVE MD-ARCHIVE

# 2. Scan for existing documentation to migrate
# 3. Create the 4 core files with templates
# 4. Move historical files to MD-ARCHIVE/
```

### **STEP 2: SETUP WIZARD (Essential Questions)**

After setup, prompt user with these questions to populate the files:

#### **ü§ù Working Relationship (Questions 1-4 of 21)**
- **Q1/21**: "What's your role? (e.g., CEO, Developer, Designer, PM)"
- **Q2/21**: "What's your technical background? (e.g., Non-technical founder, Senior developer, etc.)"
- **Q3/21**: "How should I challenge you? (Push back on bad ideas, Question approaches, etc.)"
- **Q4/21**: "What's your preferred working style? (Fast iteration, Careful planning, etc.)"

#### **üìã Project Context (Questions 5-9 of 21)**
- **Q5/21**: "What's your project name?"
- **Q6/21**: "What's the tech stack? (React, Python, etc.)"
- **Q7/21**: "What's the current version/status?"
- **Q8/21**: "What's the main Git branch for deployment?"
- **Q9/21**: "Where is this deployed? (Vercel, AWS, local only, etc.)"

#### **üéØ Current Priorities (Questions 10-13 of 21)**
- **Q10/21**: "What are you working on RIGHT NOW? (3-5 specific tasks)"
- **Q11/21**: "What's the biggest problem you're trying to solve?"
- **Q12/21**: "Any current blockers or known issues?"
- **Q13/21**: "What's the next major milestone?"

#### **üîß Development Workflow (Questions 14-17 of 21)**
- **Q14/21**: "What commands do you run to start development? (npm run dev, etc.)"
- **Q15/21**: "What commands build/deploy your project?"
- **Q16/21**: "Any special setup instructions?"
- **Q17/21**: "Common debugging patterns you've encountered?"

#### **üìö Existing Knowledge (Questions 18-21 of 21)**
- **Q18/21**: "Do you have existing documentation I should preserve?"
- **Q19/21**: "Any debugging patterns or solutions you want to remember?"
- **Q20/21**: "Team conventions or coding standards?"
- **Q21/21**: "Common gotchas or lessons learned?"

### **STEP 3: FILE POPULATION**

Use answers to generate:

1. **MD-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md**: Customized with their working relationship and project details
2. **MD-YYYYMMDD-INITIAL-SETUP.md**: Session bookmark with their current priorities  
3. **MD-[PROJECT-NAME]-BUILD-GUIDE.md**: Architecture guide with their tech stack
4. **MD-CLAUDE-TECHNICAL-MASTERY-REFERENCE.md**: Fresh template with empty sections, seeded with any patterns they mentioned

### **STEP 4: VERIFICATION**

After setup:
1. **Show folder structure** created
2. **Test session protocol**: "Say 'session start' to test the system"
3. **Confirm next steps**: "Here are your top 3 priorities based on our conversation..."

### **STEP 5: CLEANUP & FAREWELL**

**MANDATORY FINAL STEP - Execute automatically:**

1. **Move setup wizard to archive**:
   ```bash
   mv MD-CLAUDE-CODE-SETUP-WIZARD.md MD-ARCHIVE/
   ```

2. **Verify clean project state**: Only 4 files in project root:
   - MD-ACTIVE/ contains exactly 4 files
   - Setup wizard moved to MD-ARCHIVE/
   - Project ready for productive work

3. **Clean goodbye message**:
   ```
   üéâ **SETUP WIZARD COMPLETE!**
   
   ‚úÖ Documentation system ready (4 active files)
   ‚úÖ Setup wizard archived to MD-ARCHIVE/
   ‚úÖ Project optimized for maximum Claude Code productivity
   
   **Your project now has perfect AI-assisted development setup!**
   
   üìã Next Steps:
   1. Tell Claude: "Read @MD-ACTIVE/ and session start"
   2. Claude will read all 4 files and begin working
   3. Your top 3 priorities are already tracked and ready
   4. Technical Mastery Reference will grow as you solve problems
   
   üöÄ **Ready for maximum productivity!**
   ```

### **WIZARD CONVERSATION EXAMPLE**

```
ü§ñ Claude: "I've created your MD-ACTIVE/ and MD-ARCHIVE/ folders! Now let's customize the system for you.

ü§ù Working Relationship (Questions 1-4 of 21):
Q1/21 - What's your role in this project?"

üë§ User: "I'm the CEO and founder, but I'm not a developer"

ü§ñ Claude: "Got it! So I should challenge technical decisions and explain things clearly.
Q2/21 - What's your technical background?"

üë§ User: "Non-technical founder, I understand concepts but don't code"

ü§ñ Claude: "Perfect. That helps me know how to explain things.
Q3/21 - How should I push back when I think an approach might be wrong?"

üë§ User: "Be direct, offer alternatives, don't just say yes to everything"

ü§ñ Claude: "Excellent. I'll challenge decisions constructively.
Q4/21 - What's your preferred working style?"

üë§ User: "Fast iteration, get something working quickly then polish"

ü§ñ Claude: "üìã Project Context (Questions 5-9 of 21):
Q5/21 - What's your project name?"
